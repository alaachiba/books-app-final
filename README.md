## üöÄ Getting Started

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js & npm
- Angular CLI (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)
- PHP >= 8.1
- Composer
- MySQL
- XAMPP or Laravel Valet (for local development)

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Backend Setup (Laravel 10)

```bash
cd back
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```
‚öôÔ∏è Configure .env File
Edit the .env file to connect to your MySQL database named books:

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=books        # ‚úÖ Your MySQL database name
DB_USERNAME=root         # Change if needed
DB_PASSWORD=             # Add password if applicable

Then run the database migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve
```
The backend API will run at:
http://localhost:8000

üåê Frontend Setup (Angular 16)
```bash
cd front
npm install
ng serve
```
The frontend app will run at:
http://localhost:4200

‚úÖ Important: In your Angular service (book.service.ts), ensure the API base URL is:

private apiUrl = 'http://localhost:8000/api/books';
Also make sure CORS is configured in Laravel to allow requests from Angular (http://localhost:4200).
